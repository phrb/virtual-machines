virtual-machines:

This repo contains two virtual machines that assemble and run
a very simple assembly language.

The first one is written in Perl and runs assembly code, similar to the
samples provided in ./perl/simple_programs.

The other is written in Java, and compiles a high-level language into Java
code.

They were written with the purpose to learn, and have no other use. Yet.
